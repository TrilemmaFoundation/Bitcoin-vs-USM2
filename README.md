# Bitcoin-vs-USM2

We "fish" for significance by testing cointegration between Bitcoin and US M2 over more than 150 different temporal alignments.

The data spans various periods:

- 2010-2025,
- 2017-2025,
- 2022-2025,

and we consider US M2 leading by 0 to 52 weeks.

In all cases except one, specifically the 43-week lead on US M2 for post-2022 data, the cointegration tests failed to show any significant relationship. This strongly suggests that there is no meaningful long-run equilibrium linking Bitcoin to a leading measure of US M2. The single significant result is most likely a chance occurrence, an artifact of multiple comparisons, rather than evidence of a substantive economic connection.

Unfortunately, neither of us will be rich trading Bitcoin using US M2. Feel free to send your "Global M2" for similar tests.
